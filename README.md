<ul>
By analysing the merged trade and market sentiment through charts, we can clearly observe that/n
<li>Trade volume and profit potential are high during extreme greed and extreme fear.</li>
<li>Buy trades increses during fear, suggesting some traders buy when the market is low.</li>
<li>>Sell trades are high during greed, indicating profit making is more.</li>
<li>This shows a opposite behavior (contrarian pattern).Traders act opposite to sentiment.</li>
</ul>
So by recognizing these patterns,we can make smarter trading decisions.Like traders can look for buying opportunities during fear and plan to sell during greed to maximize profit.
